Sensocol Binary Request - C Implementation
==========================================

Notes:
* Explanation of functions and code is in comments
* This library does NOT use dynamic memory allocation and instead relies on pre-allocated buffers.
* It is recommended to hardcode the schema and schema MD5 instead of using the provided functions.
* sc_platform.h should be updated to fit your platform.  Remember, sensocol is a little endian protocol.
